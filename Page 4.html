<img src="homelandsecurity.jpg" width="500">
<p style="color:Black;"> After I graduate I hope to get a good paying job that will look good on a resume for the future. My long-term career goal is to work for the federal government in law enforcement in a department like Homeland Security, the FBI, ICE, or ATF. This type of career interests me because of the importance to our country these jobs carry and the inability to predict what that day on the job will bring. I hope to start a family one day and have children to raise. Another goal of mine is to one day have a vacation house somewhere secluded on the water, whether it be the ocean or a lake.</p>
