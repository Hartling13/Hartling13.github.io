<p style="color:LightGray;">I enjoy playing hockey and baseball, as well as going to the gym in my free time. I like to spend time outside doing things like going to the beach/lake and even doing yardwork. I played hockey and baseball my whole life and both sports have played a significant role in building my character. My true passion is hockey and I am lucky enough to play on the club team here at Umaine. We've gone on a good amount of road trips around New England and have played schools like Umass, Uconn, Providence, and took a trip to Ft.Myers Florida to play Florida Gulf Coast University. </p>
