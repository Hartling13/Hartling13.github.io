<h1 style="border: 2px solid Tomato;">About Me</h1>
<p style="font-family:courier;" style="color:LightGray;">I am Christian Hartling and I am from Burlington, Ma. I attend the University of Maine in Orono, Maine and I am a first year student at the university. My dads name is Chris and my moms name is Julie. Burlington is about twenty to twenty-five minutes northwest of Boston. Growing up and in high school I always went to the public schools in my town. Me and my family have been coming to Maine for small vacations ever since I can remember which has instilled in me a love for the state.</p>
