    <p style="color:LightGray;"> My long-term aspiration is to graduate from Umaine with an undergraduate degree in Business in a four year time period. In the mean time, I hope to make the dean's list multiple times and succeed academically by studying hard and applying myself. I would also like to spend more time in the library because I feel as if it helps me focus and blocks out distractions. While here at Umaine it would be beneficial for me to get an internship in an area of study that would help build my resume for the future. It is important to me that by the time I graduate I will have the ability to successfully and effectively work in my field of study. Lastly, by the time I graduate I will need to have a solid resume so that I can apply for a job.</p>
